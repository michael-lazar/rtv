; not be altered unless you are defining your own developer application.

# Key Bindings
##############
; If you would like to define custom bindings, copy this section into your
; config file with the [bindings] heading. All commands must be bound to at
; least one key for the config to be valid. 
;
; 1.) Plain keys can be represented by either uppercase/lowercase characters
;     or the hexadecimal numbers referring their ascii codes. For reference, see
;     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_code_chart
;         e.g. Q, q, 1, ?
;         e.g. 0x20 (space), 0x3c (less-than sign)
;
; 2.) Special ascii control codes should be surrounded with <>. For reference,
;     see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_control_code_chart
;         e.g. <LF> (enter), <ESC> (escape)
;
; 3.) Other special keys are defined by curses, they should be surrounded by <>
;     and prefixed with KEY_. For reference, see
;     https://docs.python.org/2/library/curses.html#constants
;         e.g. <KEY_LEFT> (left arrow), <KEY_F5>, <KEY_NPAGE> (page down)
;
; Notes:
; - Curses <KEY_ENTER> is unreliable and should always be used in conjunction
;   with <LF>.
; - Use 0x20 for the space key.
; - A subset of Ctrl modifiers are available through the ascii control codes.
;   For example, Ctrl-D will trigger an <EOT> signal. See the table above for
;   a complete reference.
