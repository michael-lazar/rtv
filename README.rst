--------------
Authentication
--------------

RTV enables you to login to your reddit account in order to perform actions like voting and leave comments.
The login process uses OAuth [#]_ and follows these steps:

1. Initiate a login by pressing the ``u`` key.
2. Open a new webpage where reddit will ask you to authorize the application.
3. Click **Accept**.

RTV will retrieve an auth token with your information and store it locally in ``{HOME}/.config/rtv/refresh-token``.
You can disable storing the token by setting ``persistent=False`` in the config.

Note that RTV no longer allows you to input your username/password directly. This method of cookie based authentication has been deprecated by reddit [#]_.

========
Settings
========

-------------
Configuration
-------------

Configuration settings are stored in ``{HOME}/.config/rtv/rtv.cfg``.
Auto-generate the config file by running

.. code-block:: bash

    $ rtv --copy-config

See the `default config <https://github.com/michael-lazar/rtv/blob/master/rtv/rtv.cfg>`_ for the full list of settings.

------
Editor
------

You can compose posts and reply to comments using your preferred text editor.
Set the editor by changing ``$RTV_EDITOR`` in your environment.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ export RTV_EDITOR=gedit

If not specified, the default system ``$EDITOR`` (or *nano*) will be used.

-----------
Web Browser
-----------

You can open submission links using your web browser.
On most systems the default web browser will open in a new window.
If you prefer the complete terminal experience, set ``$BROWSER`` to a console-based web browser.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ export BROWSER=w3m

`w3m <http://w3m.sourceforge.net/>`_, `lynx <http://lynx.isc.org/>`_, and `elinks <http://elinks.or.cz/>`_ are all good choices.

FAQ
===

Why am I getting an error during installation/when launching rtv?
  If your distro ships with an older version of python 2.7 or python-requests,
  you may experience SSL errors or other package incompatibilities. The
  easiest way to fix this is to install rtv using python 3. If you
  don't already have pip3, see http://stackoverflow.com/a/6587528 for setup
  instructions. Then do

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo pip uninstall rtv
    $ sudo pip3 install -U rtv

How do I run the repository code directly?
  This project is structured to be run as a python *module*. This means that in
  order to resolve imports you need to launch using python's ``-m`` flag.
  This method works for all versions of python. See the example below, which
  assumes that you have cloned the repository into the directory
  **~/rtv_project**.

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ~/rtv_project
    $ python3 -m rtv

How do I run the tests?
  This project uses `pytest <http://pytest.org/>`_ and `VCR.py <https://vcrpy.readthedocs.org/>`_.

  .. code-block:: bash
    
    $ pip3 install pytest
    $ # The pip release for VCR.py is out-of-date
    $ pip3 install git+https://github.com/kevin1024/vcrpy.git
    $ cd ~/rtv_project
    $ # Run the full suite
    $ PYTHONPATH=. py.test
    $ # or a single test
    $ PYTHONPATH=. py.test tests/test_config.py::test_copy_default_config

  VCR.py will record HTTP requests made during the test run and store
  them in *tests/cassettes/*. By default these cassettes are read-only,
  if you would like to record new cassettes you must provide your own refresh token.

  .. code-block:: bash

     $ PYTHONPATH=. py.test --record-mode=once --refresh-token=~/.config/rtv/refresh-token
