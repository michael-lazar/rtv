=============
Configuration
=============

------
Editor
------

RTV allows users to compose comments and replies using their preferred text editor (**vi**, **nano**, **gedit**, etc).
You can specify which text editor you would like to use by setting the ``$RTV_EDITOR`` environment variable.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ export RTV_EDITOR=gedit

If no editor is specified, RTV will fallback to the system's default ``$EDITOR``, and finally to ``nano``.

-----------
Web Browser
-----------

RTV has the capability to open links inside of your web browser.
By default RTV will use the system's browser.
On most systems this corresponds to a graphical browser such as Firefox or Chrome.
If you prefer to stay in the terminal, use ``$BROWSER`` to specify a console-based web browser.
`w3m <http://w3m.sourceforge.net/>`_, `lynx <http://lynx.isc.org/>`_, and `elinks <http://elinks.or.cz/>`_ are all good choices.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ export BROWSER=w3m

--------------
Authentication
--------------

RTV uses OAuth to facilitate logging into your reddit user account [#]_. The login process follows these steps:

1. You initiate a login by pressing the ``u`` key.
2. You're redirected to a webbrowser where reddit will ask you to login and authorize RTV.
3. RTV uses the generated token to login on your behalf.
4. The token is stored on your computer at ``{HOME}/.config/rtv/refresh-token`` for future sessions. You can disable this behavior by setting ``persistent=False`` in your RTV config.

Note that RTV no longer allows you to input your username/password directly. This method of cookie based authentication has been deprecated by reddit and will not be supported in future releases [#]_.

-----------
Config File
-----------

RTV stores configuration settings in ``{HOME}/.config/rtv/rtv.cfg``.
You can auto-generate the config file by running

.. code-block:: bash

   $ rtv --copy-config

See the `default config <https://github.com/michael-lazar/rtv/blob/master/rtv/rtv.cfg>`_ to view descriptions for each setting.

FAQ
===

Why am I getting an error during installation/when launching rtv?
  If your distro ships with an older version of python 2.7 or python-requests,
  you may experience SSL errors or other package incompatibilities. The
  easiest way to fix this is to install rtv using python 3. If you
  don't already have pip3, see http://stackoverflow.com/a/6587528 for setup
  instructions. Then do

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo pip uninstall rtv
    $ sudo pip3 install -U rtv

How do I run the repository code directly?
  This project is structured to be run as a python *module*. This means that in
  order to resolve imports you need to launch using python's ``-m`` flag.
  This method works for all versions of python. See the example below, which
  assumes that you have cloned the repository into the directory
  **~/rtv_project**.

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ~/rtv_project
    $ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.py3.txt
    $ python3 -m rtv
